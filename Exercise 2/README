# Exercise 2: T&C Reader

You are writing an endpoint that answer questions from users in a different language.
The endpoint will check if the answer can be found in the Bank's T&C. If so, the answer will be answered directly in the ame language the user used, otherwise the sytem will indicate that an agent will be answering the question.

In case of error processing the system should also indicate that an agent will be answering the question.

Example questions:

- What happens in case of conflicts between Arabic and English
- Who can initiate a transfer in a joint account?
- What credit card can I apply to with a salaty of 10,000 Dirhams

# Output:

{ "response": "<RESPONSE>",  "language": "<DETECTED_LANGUAGE>" }

# Bonus:
Add sentiment analysis of the input in the output, so that the agent can be ready for it. E.g.:

{ "response": "<RESPONSE>",  "language": "<DETECTED_LANGUAGE>": sentiment: "<angry|happy|neutral>" }
