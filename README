# Exercise 1: Twitter moderation

You are writing a twitter moderation REST endpoint for our social media campaigns.
E.g.:

 - https://twitter.com/ENBDdeals
 - https://twitter.com/EmiratesNBD_AE
 

## Rules:
- Professional tone.
- Less than 200 character.

If the tweet is too long:
- Create a summarised version

If the tweet is not professional enough:
- Rewrite it in a profesional tone

Once the Twitter passes moderation
- Suggest exactly 3 hashtags for it.

## OUTPUT
The new Tweet
