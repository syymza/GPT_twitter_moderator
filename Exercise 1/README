# Exercise 1: Twitter moderation

You are writing a twitter moderation REST endpoint for our social media campaigns.
E.g.:

 - https://twitter.com/ENBDdeals
 - https://twitter.com/EmiratesNBD_AE
 

## Rules:
- Professional tone.
- Less than 400 character.

If the tweet is too long:
- Create a summarised version

If the tweet is not professional enough:
- Rewrite it in a profesional tone

Once the Twitter passes moderation, replace any pre-existing hashtag.
Then:
- Suggest exactly 3 hashtags for it.

## Output
The new Tweet


## Examples
- We are the best bank in the world, all the other banks suck.
- Yay, we are going to clean up the ocean, our staff will volunteer! What a day!
- In celebration of World Ocean Day, volunteer scuba divers from the Exchanger Volunteering Programme participated in an exceptional Dive Cleanup at Dadna Harbour in Fujairah, leaving a lasting impact on the UAEâ€™s waters.Their efforts provide a strong message of optimism and togetherness, demonstrating that we can achieve a cleaner and better future for our oceans when we work together. Start taking charge to protect our beautiful blue planet!
